Working With Dynamic WebElements Using XPath
    - There are situations when a web application may contain dynamic WebElements
        - Dynamic WebElement is when the value on an application changes at runtime
        - Dynamic WebElement manifests when the value of an attribute changes upon reloading the
          web application.
    - The home page of yahoo is a perfect example of a dynamic WebElements
        - The list box WebElements change when the page reloads
        - A user has to search for information and select an option from the list of options
            - Each set of options contains a different value for ID attribute
    - An exception occurs if the locator attempts to find a dynamic element
        - The test script will not find the element because the value changed
        - Relative XPath can find dynamic WebElements utilizing a partial pattern match
            - The partial pattern match locates a WebElement based on part of the value
            - Syntax [PartialPatternMatch(@AttributeName,’AttributeValue’)]
