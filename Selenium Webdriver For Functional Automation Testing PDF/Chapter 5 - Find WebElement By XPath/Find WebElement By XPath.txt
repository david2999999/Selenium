Find WebElement By XPath
    - XML Path Language "XPath" is a powerful method for finding WebElements
        - The XPath locator type refers to a specific node in the DOM tree
        - The XPath can be retrieved using the web page's HTML or an inspector tool that generates
          the XPath
    - XPath locator accepts two types of parameters strings
        - Absolute XPath - generate a complete XPath starting from the <html> tag or
          single forward slash (/)
        - Relative XPath - generates a shortened version of the XPath starting with double slashes (//)
