Find And Perform Actions On WebElements
    - WebDriver has two methods to find WebElements
        - findElement()
        - findElements()
    - The difference between the two methods is the number of return WebElements
        - findElement() returns a single element
            - will throw an exception if there are no elements to be found
        - findElements() returns multiple elements
            - return an empty list if no elements are found
    - It is important to know a driver object must be created before searching for a WebElement
        - There are different kind of driver objects for different browsers

Syntax
    - findElement()
        - driver.findElement(By.locatorType("value"));
            - WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.id("value"));
    - findElements()
