- 'WebDriver driver' is the interface for driving the browser
    - Currently, the object reference variable 'driver' points to nothing, but will be instantiated with
      a Chrome Driver object.
        - The Chrome Driver means testing is controlled on the Chrome Browser
    - In this example, the System.setProperty() method was not used since the ChromeDriver path was placed
      in Environment Variables - System variables
        - If we do not have the ChromeDriver path in system variables, we can manually set it with
            - System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "PATH TO CHROME DRIVER ON DISK");
