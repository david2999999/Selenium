Windows
    - Selenium WebDriver assigns an alphanumeric id called window handle to all windows
        - This id is unique and used to switch control between each window
    - The methods include
        1. getWindowHandle() – get the current window handle
        2. getWindowHandles() – get a set of window handles
        3. switchTo().window() – switch focus between windows
