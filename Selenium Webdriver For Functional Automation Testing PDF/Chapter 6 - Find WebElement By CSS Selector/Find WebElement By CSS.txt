Find WebElement By CSS Selector
    - Using CSS selector is a robust method for finding WebElements
    - This locator type is very similar to the XPath locator type
    - CSS Selectors can start with many symbols, each symbol represents different kind of attributes
        - # (pound, number, or hash tag sign) indicates the ID attribute
        - . (dot) is a symbol that represents the class attribute
            - Syntax: By.cssSelector(".Automation"), this will retrieve all elements with the class name of 'Automation'
            - You can also identify an element using class if the tag type is 'Test' and class name is 'Automation'
                - Syntax: (By.cssSelector("Test.Automation")), this will retrieve only elements with the tag name and the class name
    - The difference between the CSS selector and relative XPath is the two forward slashes and the "@" symbol before attribute name
        - CSS Selector syntax = TagName[AttributeName=’AttributeValue’]
        - Relative XPath syntax = //TagName[@AttributeName=’AttributeValue’]
