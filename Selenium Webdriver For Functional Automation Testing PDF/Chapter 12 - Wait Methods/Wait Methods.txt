Wait Methods
    - Group of methods that pause between execution statements
        - This is beneficial for AJAX applications
        - AJAX stands for Asynchronous Javascript and XML, which is technique for designing async applications
        - The application does not have to reload the web page while exchanging data with a server
          and updating parts of the web page
    - When a browser loads a web page, the WebElement may load at different time intervals
        - If a WebElement is not identified by a certain time, an exception will cause the test script to fail
    - There are several wait methods but the most utilized methods are
        - Implicit Wait
            - default waiting time for each test step within the entire test script
                - While waiting, WebDriver continues polling the DOM for the WebElement
                    - If the WebElement is located before the default time, then the next Test
                      step is executed
                    - If the WebElement is not located within the specified time then an exception show up
            - Time Method accepts 2 parameters
                - time - Accepts the time as an integer value
                - unit - accepts the time measurement in terms of SECONDS, NANOSECONDS, MINUTES, MILLISECONDS,
                         MICROSECONDS, HOURS, and DAYS
             Note: The method should be used prior to loading the web page within the setUp() method
        - Explicit Wait
            - Limited to a specific WebElement
            - Interrupt execution until time has elapsed or an expected condition is met
                - This condition must be satisfied before proceeding to the next Test Step
            - Selenium Webdriver offers a WebDriverWait class and an ExpectedConditions class to assist Explicit Wait
                - WebDriverWait creates an object reference and use an instance of WebDriver
                    - The maximum number of seconds is added for execution inactivity
                        - If a WebElement is not found then an exception is thrown
