    - Group of methods that perform an action on the browser
        - Each method can be accessed after creating an object of WebDriver, then writing the
          object's name followed by a dot operator.


    close() - Closes the current active window if there are multiple windows. The browser quits if only one window is active
    get(String url) - Loads a new web page in the current browser window

    getPageSource() - Gets the complete page source of the loaded web page.
    getTitle() - Gets the current page title
    quit() - Stops/Quits the driver instance and close all open browser windows

        - quit() - close the browser window but thd driver closes after executing a Test Script
