Selenium WebDriver Architecture
    - After you trigger the Test
        - The Selenium code will be converted to JSON format.
    - Generated JSON is send to the Browser Driver (Server) through http Protocol
        - Each Browser contains a separate browser driver.
    - The drivers communicate with its respective browsers and execute the commands by
      interpreting json which is has received on the browser.
    - Driver receives response from the browser and it sends JSON response back to client.
