Implicit Wait
    - Global wait time
    - Wait for n number of seconds before throwing exception
    - If the loading takes less than n seconds
        - It will not wait for n seconds, but will execute the exact time the element
          finishes loading
        - n is the maximum time it will wait

Explicit Wait
    - Target a specific WebElement
        - When there is an exception of wait time, where the time needed may be longer than
          the implicit wait

    - WebDriverWait, continuously monitors the DOM for the element
    - FluentWait, polls repeatedly at regular intervals of time until the timeout or till the object
        gets found.

Thread Sleep
    - Part of the Java Language
        - Stops the code execution for a set amount of time
        - Not preferred in real time projects
            - There is no point waiting for 5 seconds if the WebElement loads in 3 seconds
