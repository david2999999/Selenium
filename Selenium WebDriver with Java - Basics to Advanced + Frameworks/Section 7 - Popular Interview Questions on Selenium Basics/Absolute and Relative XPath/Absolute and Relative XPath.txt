What is the difference between absolute and relative XPath?
    - XPath is a query language for selecting nodes from an XML document
    - Relative XPath
        - We directly find/access the node without relying on its parent nodes
        - More preferred than absolute XPath
    - Absolute XPath
        - Find/access the node by parent child traversal
