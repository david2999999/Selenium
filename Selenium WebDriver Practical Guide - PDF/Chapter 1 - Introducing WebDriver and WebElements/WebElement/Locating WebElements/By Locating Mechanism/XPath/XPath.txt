XPath
    - WebDriver uses XPath to identify a WebElement on the webpage
    - XPath is short name for the XML path
        - The HTML for our web page is also one form of the XML document
    - So in order to identify an element on an HTML page we need to use a specific XPath
      syntax as follows
        - The root element is identified as //
        - To identify all the div elements, the syntax will be //div
        - To identify the link tags that are within the div element
            - the syntax will be //div/a
        - To identify all the elements with a tag, we use *.
            - The syntax will be //div/*
        - To identify all the div elements that are at three levels down from the root,
          we can use //*/*/div
        - We identify specific elements, we use attribute values of those elements,
          such as //*/div/a[@id='attrValue], which will return the anchor element
          - This element is at third level from root within a div element, and has an id attribute
