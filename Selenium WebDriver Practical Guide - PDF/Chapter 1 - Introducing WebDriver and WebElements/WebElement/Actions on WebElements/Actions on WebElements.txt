Actions on WebElement
    - Different WebElements will have different actions that can be taken on them
        - Example:
            - Textbox element, we can type in some text or clear the text that is already typed in
            - Button element, we can click on it, get the dimensions of it, and so on
    - All the actions are listed in one WebElement interface
        - It is the test script developer's responsibility to use the actions that are supported by
          the target element
        - If the action is incompatible on a WebElement, WebDriver ignores such actions silently
