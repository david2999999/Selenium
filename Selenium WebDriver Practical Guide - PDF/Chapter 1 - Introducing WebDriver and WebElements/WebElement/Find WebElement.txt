The findElement() method
    - In UI automation, locating an element is the first step before executing any user actions on it
    - The findElement() method is a way to locate an element on the web page
        - The method declaration is as follows
            - WebElement findElement(By by)
        - The 'By' instance is a WebElement-locating mechanism
        - There are eight different ways to locate a WebElement on a web page
        - The method returns the first WebElement that the driver comes across which satisfies the
          locating-mechanism condition
    - If the WebDriver does not find the element, it throws a runtime exception names
      NoSuchElementException
    - The test script developer is advised to avoid using this method if he/she thinks the WebElement
      will not be present on the web page
        - For those purposes, we can use another method of WebDriver name findElements
