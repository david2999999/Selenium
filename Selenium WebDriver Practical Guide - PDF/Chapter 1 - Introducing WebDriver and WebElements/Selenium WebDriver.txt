Selenium WebDriver
    - Give a better control on the browser by implementing browser specific implementations
    - Better programming experience to developers by adhering closely to the object-oriented programming
      fundamentals.

Process Flow
    - Tester or developer can use his/her test script to command WebDriver to perform
      certain actions on the WAUT on a certain browser
    - By using the language binding client libraries, developers can invoke the
      browser-specific implementations of Webdriver
        - Firefox, IE, Opera and so on
    - After execution, WebDriver will send out the test result back to the test script for
      developer's analysis
