Handling Alerts
    - Webdriver provides an API to handle alert dialogs
        - Alert alert()
    - The preceding method will switch to the currently active modal dialog on the web page
        - It returns an Alert instance where appropriate actions can be taken on the dialog
        - If there is no dialog currently presents, it throws back a NoAlertPresentException
    - The interface provides 4 methods
        - accept(), invoke the OK button
        - dismiss(), clicking on the CANCEL action button
        - getText(), retrieve the text that appears on the dialog
        - sendKeys(), type in some text into the alert if the alert has some provision
