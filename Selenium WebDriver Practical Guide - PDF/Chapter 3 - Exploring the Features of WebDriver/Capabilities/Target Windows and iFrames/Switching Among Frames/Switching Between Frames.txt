Switching Between Frames
    - The API syntax for the frame is as follows:
        - WebDriver frame(int index)
    - The methods takes the index of the frame that we want to switch to
        - If we have three frames, WebDriver indexes them as 0, 1, and 2
    - If we want to switch among frames using their names by using the overloaded method
        - WebDriverframe(String frameNameOrframeID)
    - We also have a choice to get the frame by WebElement
        - WebDriver frame(WebElement frameElement)
