Switching Among Windows
    - Every time we open a web page using WebDriver in a browser window, WebDriver
      assigns a window handler to that
        - WebDriver uses this identifier to identify the window
    - When we click on a link, a search page is opened in a different window
        - At this point, in the WebDriver, there are two window handles registered
        - On the screen, the search page is in the front and has the focus
            - If we want to switch back to the first browser window, we can use WebDriver's
              switchTo() method to do that.
