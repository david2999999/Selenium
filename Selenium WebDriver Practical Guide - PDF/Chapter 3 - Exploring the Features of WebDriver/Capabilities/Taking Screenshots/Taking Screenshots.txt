Screenshots
    - Very handy when the test case fails, and we want to see the state of the application, when
      the test fails
    - The 'TakesScreenShot' interface in the WebDriver library is implemented by all the
      different variants of WebDriver.
        - This capability is enabled in all browsers by default
        - This is a read-only capability, a user does not have much say on toggling it
    - Syntax
        - public <X> X getScreenshotAs(OutputType<X> target)
        - The OutputType is another interface
            - There are three different formats, BASE64, BYTES, and FILE
            - The FILE format writes the data into a .png files, which will be deleted once
              the JVM is killed
